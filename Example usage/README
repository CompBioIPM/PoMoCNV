Example Workflow with cnv_simulated.bed

cnv_simulated.bed is a synthetic dataset containing copy number variation (CNV) segments across 4 populations, each with 10 individuals.

STEP 1 — Encode CNVs into codons
Run the Bed2Fasta.R script in R to convert copy number states into codons.
Input: cnv_simulated.bed
Output: codon_encoded.fasta

STEP 2 — Run evolutionary inference
Use the PoMoCNV.bf script in the HyPhy package to estimate copy number mutation rate and fitness loss per copy deletion.

Input: codon_encoded.fasta and phylogenetic tree.
Output: HyPhy_output.txt

Tree specification
The example dataset assumes 4 populations with the phylogenetic tree:

myTree = ((pop_1:1.0,pop_3:1.0)a1:1.0,(pop_2:1.0,pop_4:1.0)a2:1.0);


This tree is specified in PoMoCNV.bf. Replace it with a tree matching your population number and their evolutionary relationships.
